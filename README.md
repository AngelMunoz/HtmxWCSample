# HTMX + Fable.Lit Web Components

This is a sample repository of combining some cool new old tech choices, render HTML from the server as in the 00's with a little bit of modernity with Web Components.

Avoiding Javascript these days is quite _hard_ given what the ecosystem gives you and the dynamics users expect from your websites. Web components tend to do one thing and do it well that makes them quite useful and as portable as any other HTML tag; They take properties/attributes and emit events to let you know something happened, this is a very simple model to work with that allows your server side rendered website to take advantage of a web standards modern approach, **while it requires javascript... It doesn't force you to write your full website in javascript**

### Ok Where's the code?

check `Extensions.fs`, `BaseView.fs`, and `Views/Home.fs`
